In this project we are going to study different heuristics applicable to 8 puzzle problem.
These heuristics are as follows

    1.Number of misplaced tiles.
    2.Sum of Manhattan distance. 
    3.Least cost branch and bound.
    4.Linear conflict heuristic.
    5.Number of tiles out of row + Number of tiles out of column
    6.n Max swap
    7.n swap

Above mentioned all are the admissible heuristics which are usefull to solve 8 puzzle problem.
So our aim is to analyse all these heuristic methods with respect to each other.
